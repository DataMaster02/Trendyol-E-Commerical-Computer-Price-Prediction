I created a dataset by collecting information on computer specifications, prices, user ratings, and the number of likes from the Trendyol e-commerce platform. 
After analyzing and cleaning the data, I developed a machine learning model to predict computer prices.
I collected customer reviews on computers from the Trendyol e-commerce platform and performed sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of the reviews. 
After that, I developed a machine learning model that classifies sentiments based on user rating scores.
